Basic idea: use python "normalvariate" function to calculate the normal
             distribution, and give the final total happinese value.
Step: first find out the ND of three each resturant, sort them, then choose the one with the
      greatest for the remain 297 times.

input: C1 ( 9, 3),
       C2 (7, 5),
       C3 (11, 7)
